# Hi! 

My name is Nataliia.   I am from Ukraine. In March 2022, I moved to Germany.   Since September 2023, I started learning ```HTML``` and ```CSS```. I became deeply fascinated by the world of IT, and in 2024, I took a bold step and enrolled in three courses, one of which is a Bootcamp at Neue Fische. Currently, I am diving deeper into learning ```JavaScript``` and programming languages in general.

I am pursuing my dream and studying intensively to make it a reality.

- Item 1: I am confidently studying **web development** ðŸ’«
- Item 2: I am learning German and English ðŸ–‹
- Item 3: I believe everything will be fine (a little bit of a stretch, but I want to believe it) ðŸ¤—
