My name is Nataliia. I am from Ukraine. As of March 1, 2022, I am in Germany. When I arrived in Germany, I only knew a few words in German from a song: "Sieben Sieben ilyulyu, Sieben Sieben Eins Zwei" [Verka Serduchka](h)

[The song]() (performed by Verka Serduchka). 

Currently, I am pursuing my dream and studying here.

- Item 1: I am confidently studying web development 💫
- Item 2: I am learning German and English 🖋
- Item 3: I believe everything will be fine (a little bit of a stretch, but I want to believe it) 🤗
