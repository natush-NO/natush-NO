My name is Nataliia. I am from Ukraine. As of March 1, 2022, I am in Germany. When I arrived in Germany, I only knew a few words in German from a song: "Sieben Sieben ilyulyu, Sieben Sieben Eins Zwei" [The song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8CO3FmgWyI) (performed by Verka Serduchka). 
Currently, I am pursuing my dream and studying here.

- Item 1: I am confidently studying web developmentğŸ’«
- Item 2: I am learning German and EnglishğŸ–‹
- Item 3: I believe everything will be fine (a little bit of a stretch, but I want toÂ believeÂ it)ğŸ¤—
