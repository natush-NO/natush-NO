# Hi! 

**I am Nataliia**.

I am from **Ukraine**.                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
In March 2022, I moved to **Germany**.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
Since September 2023, I started learning ```HTML``` and ```CSS```. Then I became deeply fascinated by the world of IT, and in 2024, I took a bold step and enrolled in three courses, one of which was a Bootcamp at Neue Fische. After successfully completing my studies at Neue Fische, I became even more immersed in learning. Currently, I am diving deeper into learning ```JavaScript``` and programming languages in general.
My skills that I am improving also include ```React``` and ```Next.js```.

#### I am pursuing my dream and studying intensively to make it a reality.

- Item 1: I am confidently studying **web development** ðŸ’«
- Item 2: I am learning **German** and **English** ðŸ–‹
- Item 3: I believe **everything will be fine** (a little bit of a stretch, but I want to believe it) ðŸ¤—
